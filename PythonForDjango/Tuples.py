# ### Tuples are immutable:
# tp = "mohabbat","Hridoy","mhr"
# # tp[2] = "other girl"
# print(tp)
# tp = ("mohabbat",['hridoy','mhr'])
# tp[1][1] = 'khr'
# print(tp)

# tp = 23,32,21,12,
# tp = 23
# tp = 23,
# print(type(tp))

#homogeneous => List
#homogeneous = on kind of data type(int or string or float etc)
